# realmTest
This iOS app classic "to do list" for trying to work with Realm.
I used Realm for storing data, SwipeCellKit for implementing swipe cell functional with delete and update button, and ChameleonFramework for colour scheme.

Using this app you can create/update/delete category, create/update/delete to do list item in each category.
